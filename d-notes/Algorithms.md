I am finding it difficult to mentally understand Recursion. If its an Iteration, I can mentally understand it. 

Lets say if you are sorting a value using decrease and conquer approach.

In Iteration, we would assign a value to a pointer and the next pointer would iterate the whole array by assigning the other values to itself and compare the value assigned to the first pointer with the other values assigned to that pointer. 

So, here the steps would be.
1. Assign the first value of the index to one pointer
2. Assign the second value of the index to the second pointer
3. Then the value of first pointer and the second pointer would be compared.
4. If the value of the second pointer is greater than the value of the first pointer, then the value of the next index would be assigned to the second pointer.
5. If it find the minimum value, then that value will be assigned to the first pointer.
6. Now that we have found the smallest value of the array and stored it in the first index, the value of the second index will be applied to the first pointer.

Now, in a iteration algorithm, we just need to remember these 6 steps and mentally picture that these 6 steps will be repeated. As for as these 6 steps are there in a for loop, all we need to picture is these 6 steps and run it in a loop. I need to know the similar psych behind mentally picturing a recursion.

But I need to understand how to mentally picture the steps in a recursion. Before given an example of a recursion (lets a tower of hanoi), tell me the psych behind mentally picturing a recursion as compared to mentally picturing iteration.
