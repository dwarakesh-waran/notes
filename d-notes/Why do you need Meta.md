Topic: [[My Security]]

I post photos to Instagram/Facebook to save my memories. It gives an architecture to store my memories in a good way.

Am I showing off by using Meta in the name of storing memories?
Do I show off my life to others so that they remember me?
But do they really remember me or do they get jealous of me?
Do I even worthy of making someone jealous?
Am I trying to pick a nerve here?
