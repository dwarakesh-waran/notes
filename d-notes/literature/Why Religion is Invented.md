[[Archetype]] is an accepted behavior of people universally. And memes are also behaviors which gets imitated by a lot of people like virus. These imitated behavior gets influenced by Archetypes.

Basically Archetypes is a fundamental behavior which gets influenced by memes and in turn gets imitated by a lot of people (within a culture or a time period).

Simple example of an archetype would be the behavior or symbol of a hero sacrificing himself for the greater good. Meme would be its adaption in Iron man or any other person who sacrifices himself for the greater good thereby getting influenced by the Archetype.

Gods competing with each other is an example of an archetype.

Imagine we're talking about how Dawkins focuses on facts and Peterson on myths. So, factually, Jesus wasn’t born of a virgin. But lets play the devil's advocate and look at the myth, there's an interesting angle.

It seems like the Bible's writers might have wanted to make sex look bad because they thought Original Sin was passed down through sex. By having Jesus born from a virgin, they were making a point that he was pure and sinless. It was like saying, "Hey, Jesus is different and perfect because he didn't come into the world through the usual sinful way."

This also made Mary pure since she didn’t have sex to conceive Jesus. If they had said she had sex with God, people back then might have called it a rip-off of pagan stories where gods often had kids with humans. By sticking with the virgin birth, they were making a clear break from those stories and creating this new idea of ultimate purity, which also kind of dissed the pagan myths.

At the 1 hour mark, Dawkins tries to come to a middle ground. He says he is prepared to believe in process of evolving manuscripts rather than the ideas coming from a divine intervention.
