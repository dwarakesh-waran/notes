1. I need to know how much to allocate to a stock when it goes down in Market.
	1. Like If it goes down below 5%, 10%, 15% and more.
	2. I need to know this to buy a stock as a lumpsum with my cash in hand.
	3. The problem here is, If I have more cash and need to allocate certain amount of money to buy a stock, I need to have an understanding of the stock and to know how much money is WORTH of an allocation to buy the stock.
	4. As of Jan 2025, I am doing biweekly DCA of $250 by buying [[Equity]] in a brokerage account ($200 in Index Fund ETFs and $50 in Stocks) and $250 by storing Cash.
	5. Lets say in the next 4 months, my cash storage became $1000, I need to know how much % of $1000 is worth to buy a 'X' [[Stock]]/[[ETF]]. 
	6. #date Today (01/27/2025) NVDA crashes down below -15%. I have $600 and bought $350 worth of NVDA, $100 worth of QQQM (-3%) and $100 (-3%) worth of SCHG. So, nearly I have used 60% of my cash to buy NVDA and 30% of my cash to buy QQQM and SCHG combined. So, I need this analysis to be done to allocate properly next time during a DIP.
2. In order to understand the first point, we need to know how much the stock is worth.
3. In order to find how much the stock is worth we need to think about 3 criteria.
	1. The company's income (revenue, profit and earnings)
	2. Balance (debt, assets and liabilities)
	3. Cash Flow.
