### **1. Creational Patterns**

These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
    
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
    
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### **2. Structural Patterns**

These focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

- **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
    
- **Bridge**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently.
    
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and composites uniformly.
    
- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
    
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, like a complex subsystem.
    
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
    
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### **3. Behavioral Patterns**

These are concerned with communication between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
    
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
    
- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
    
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
    
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing it to be restored later.
    
- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
    
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
    
- **Visitor**: Lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
