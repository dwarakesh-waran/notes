1. If a company wants money (or to raise a capital), they will create new shares. 
2. Then the company sells these shares to Investment banks or Overwriters, and they will register those shares in the share market. 
	1. Sometimes companies will sell all the shares to Investment banks or Overwriters AT A SLIGHTLY DISCOUNTED PRICE. Now these guys are responsible for selling the shares to the public. This is called a "Firm commitment Agreement" 
	2. Alternatively, they may use a **"Best-effort Agreement"**, meaning they try to sell as many shares as possible but are not obligated to buy the unsold shares. In this case, the shares may remain with the company (like in the company's own treasury) or unsold in the market.
	3. So, who owns the shares? **Unsold IPO shares** are either:
		1. Held by underwriters if they’ve committed to buying them (firm commitment).
		2. Retained by the company as treasury shares (best-effort).
	4. These total number of shares are called **outstanding shares**. The shares that come under outstanding shares are as follows
		1. Public float
		2. Restricted shares
		3. Insider shares
		4. Exercised employee stock options
	5. The shares that DOES NOT come under outstanding shares are as follows
		1. Treasury shares (the share that are issued but are brought by the same company)
		2. Unissued shares (the shares that are created but not issued. It may be issued as a secondary public offering or issued to the employees as part of a benefit plan)
	6. Now Market Capitalization of the company can be calculated by **Current Share Price×Total Outstanding Shares**. That means, if you want to fully own a company (technically), then you have to have the amount calculated as the Market Cap.
	7. Market Cap is the valuation that the market has put on the company.
3. Since the company sold the shares, that they have created, to the Investment banks or overwriters for a price, now the buying and selling of the shares by the public does NOT benefit the companies FINANCIALLY.
	1. So, FINANCIALLY it doesn't affect, but buying and selling the affects the company in the following indirect ways and more.
	2. Market Perception and Valuation
	3. Reputation and Brand Image
	4. Ability to Raise Capital
4. Now after the stock is available publicly, it can be traded publicly in the stock market at a price.
5. The price of the stock reflects the **worth of the company** to a certain degree, as it represents the market's perception of its value.
	1. However, the stock price is not the sole determinant of the company's true worth, as it also includes intrinsic factors such as assets, earnings, and future growth potential.
	2. #quote As Warren Buffet says, "PRICE IS WHAT YOU PAY AND THE VALUE IS WHAT YOU GET"
	3. That means, if a company is worth only $10 and it is getting traded at $50, then you are taking a risk here.
6. So, it is very much need to find the intrinsic value of the company. If you are continuously buying a stock at a price more that what it is worth of, then you are part of **formation of a bubble**.
	1. And we are buying these stocks at higher prices because of the,
		1. The fear of missing out
		2. Irrational Buying
7. If the stock is getting traded more than its intrinsic value, then the stock is overvalued and if the stock traded less than its intrinsic value, then the stock is undervalued.
8. Basically we need to calculate this intrinsic value. 
	1. And to calculate this value, we need to consider a lot of components.
	3. Most Importantly Free Cash Flow of a company (FCF)

	6. It is important to take the right values as well. #link https://youtu.be/46OIdfGaK-Q?si=-JMZD8qgI6EVTJq3
		1. Market cap can be calculated by multiplying number of outstanding shares and the share price. 
		2. But it is better to calculate the **Enterprise Value** which is nothing but **Market Cap - Cash + Debt.** 
		3. And the true market price would be **Enterprise value/number of outstanding shares**
		4. Take the number of outstanding shares from the Income Statement of a company (Take the Diluted instead of Basic)
		5. Take the amount of cash and debt a company has from the Balance Sheet of the company.
