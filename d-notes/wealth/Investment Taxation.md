For both NRI and Resident Indian, the taxes will be application for the interest earned in the [[Types of Investment]]s.

#catch If you are NRI, then tax will get deducted (TDS will happen) while you sell the securities. If you are Resident Indian, the tax wont get deducted while you sell the securities, instead, you have to file ITR and pay the taxes.

#fact As of 2024, the tax deducted on the [[Capital Gains]] of your investments is 12.5%. (Thank you so much Nirmal Sitharaman Ji ðŸ˜­) This is for [[LTCG]] only.

#check For Debt funds and ETFs, there is no concept of STCG and LTCG. The tax deduction of Capital Gains will be calculated based on the tax slabs.

We all know [[Using NRE to avoid CG taxation is a Wrong Assumption]].
