Zerodha is a broker Account. (Also known as Trading account)
If you create an account in Zerodha, they will create 2 accounts.
- Broker Account
- Demat Account

#catch If you already have a Demat account created separately, they will create broker account only and you can link your demat account later.

You can use their [[Coin by Zerodha]] to do your investments.

#check As an NRI, you cannot do [[Trading]]. 
You can ONLY buy shares for delivery. -> This statement means that the stocks that you buy cannot be sold on the same day (Hence NO possibility Intra Day Trading). 
So, when can we sell then? -> Once the settlement period is over, lets say 3 days, then you can sell it.

You can create [[PIS]] [[Demat Account]] and link it with both [[NRE]] and [[NRO]] bank accounts

You can create [[NON-PIS]] [[Demat Account]] and link it with both [[NRE]] and [[NRO]] bank accounts. But in [[Zerodha]], **if you need to create a NON-PIS Demat Account, then you can only link your NRO account it seems.**
