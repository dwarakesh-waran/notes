Basically I need to invest in Indian Share Market.
I moved to the USA on June 2023. 
Prior to that, I haven't done any investments in Share Market.
I wanted to start investing for a long time. But I never had excess money to start investing in the first place.
I have tried investing in Crypto Currency using services like Wazirx. But it felt like gambling.

> When you start investing with a mind set of making a lot of money *IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME*, then you would approach investing as a type of gambling.

I gambled in crypto currency. Gained a lot, but most importantly, lost a lot. So, stopped taking risks and started investing in gold and other traditional means of investing.
I have asked my brother to invest in the share market by starting an SIP. He started it using Zerodha. And I have mostly learned share market from him.
I am still planning to invest on the traditional means but I want to start exploring the Share market now.
