Roth Individual retirement account

Basically you put your post tax money and invest in index funds via this account. 
After 60 years, you would get all the money invested in this account without paying any tax.

Why it is beneficial?
The main benefit is you don't have to pay tax on your CG. #catch but if you withdraw before age 60, then thats a problem.

In India, you don't have to pay tax on CG if you do Tax Harvesting. Because India has a 0% tax policy for the first 1 lakh of your CG. So, you can withdraw the amount every year and reinvest again on the same day. This is a typical Tax Harvesting scenario in India.

So, we can use this mechanism in US to avoid paying tax for our CGs right? NO WE CAN NOT! 

Because US doesn't have a  0% tax policy like India does for its CGs. So, We need to use Roth IRA
