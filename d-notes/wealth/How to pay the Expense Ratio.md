##### So, do we need to pay the $1 separately to the AMC on their website or will they deduct the amount from portfolio?

No, the $1 won't get deducted from the portfolio and you don't have to pay them explicitly as well. 
- ***The Expense ratio is deducted from daily NAV of the fund.*** 
- So, NAV of the day is declared by the AMC after deducting the Expense ratio of the day. 
- So, We don't actually pay ER to the AMC. AMC is giving the ER detected NAV.

***Note: The expense ratio is not deducted directly from the amount that you invest. Instead, it is factored into the daily net asset value ([[NAV]]) of the fund. Essentially, it slightly reduces the fund's return on a daily basis.***

Let's say if the AMC doesn't charge any money to manage the fund, then the expense ratio would be 0% and 1%

You buy $25 worth of the same fund 4 times a year. At the end of the year, you would've bought $100 worth of that specific fund. Let's see the NAV of that fund each time you buy.

### Buy Calculations with 1% Expense Ratio (for simplicity simple interest is calculated. Usually ER is compounded daily)

**Daily Expense Ratio:** 1% ER/365 days≈0.0000274% ER per day

Given the NAV adjusts slightly due to the expense ratio, we approximate the NAV as follows:

1. **Buy 1:**
    
    - **Investment:** $25
    - **Adjusted NAV:** After 1st Quarter (91 days):NAV=100×(1−0.00274%×91)≈100×0.9975=99.75
    - **Shares Purchased:** 25/99.75 ≈ 0.0.2506
2. **Buy 2:**
    
    - **Investment:** $25
    - **Adjusted NAV:** - After 2nd Quarter (182 days):NAV=100×(1−0.00274%×182)≈100×0.995=99.50
    - **Shares Purchased:** 25/99.50 ≈ 0.2513
3. **Buy 3:**
    
    - **Investment:** $25
    - **Adjusted NAV:** After 3rd Quarter (273 days):NAV=100×(1−0.00274%×273)≈100×0.9925=99.25
    - **Shares Purchased:** 25/99.25 ≈ 0.2520
4. **Buy 4:**
    
    - **Investment:** $25
    - After 4th Quarter (365 days):NAV=100×(1−0.00274%×365)≈100×0.99=99.00
    - **Shares Purchased:** 25/99.00 ≈ 0.0.2525

### Total Shares Purchased

- **Total Shares Purchased:** 0.2506+0.2513+0.2520+0.2525≈1.0064

### Total Investment Value at Year End

- **Adjusted NAV at Year End:** $99.00
- **Total Value:** 1.0064×99.00≈99.63

In this scenario, a 1% expense ratio results in a $0.37 loss over the year on a $100 investment, reflecting the cost of managing the fund.
