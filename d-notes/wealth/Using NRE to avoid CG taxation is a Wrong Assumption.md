If you earn $1000 in US, the US government will take 25% of it as a tax and give you $750.

If you send this $750 to India to a Indian savings account, then it will be treated as an Income and you have to pay tax to Indian Government.

In order to avoid this double taxation on the income earned, NRE accounts are introduced. If you put your $750 in NRE account instead of a Indian savings account, then the tax won't be deducted by the Indian Government.

Also one key point to note here is, the interest earned from the NRE accounts are also tax-free. If I put 1 lakh Rupees in my NRE account and it has earned a 3% interest, lets say 3000 Rupees. Then I don't have to pay the tax for that 3000 Rupees.

So, using NRE account to avoid tax is a correct statement right?

Yes, it is a good idea. But it is only a good idea for profits earned as an interest. For Profits earned from MF or ETS ([[Capital Gains]]) will be tax deductible.

Sometimes the mind will think that if interest earned in NRE account is tax free, then the interest earned from MF (since we can link our PIS Demat Account to our NRE account) is tax free. 

Once you sell the units of a MF from a PIS Demat Account, then the Principal and the CG will be transferred to NRE account. Since the CGs are considered as Income earned in India, they are tax deductible.
