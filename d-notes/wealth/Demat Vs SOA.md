If you want to do investing, you can do with or without a [[Demat Account]].

If you invest your money in a mutual fund, then it (the unit) can be stored (or held) in 2 formats.
- Demat Format
- SOA (Statement of Account) Format

If you directly buy units of a mutual fund from an [[AMC]], then they will provide the info in SOA format. They can also provide in demat format. #check 

If you buy units of a mutual fund from a brokerage accounts like [[Zerodha]] or others, then they will save the info in Demat format in a [[Demat Account]]. In contrast, if you buy units from Grow, they will give you units in SOA format. PayTM Money gives the units in both SOA and Demat format it seems. Need to be checked. #check

Grow is not storing the values in Demat Format.
