If I buy a unit of an [[Index Fund]] from an AMC, they either give me the units in SOA format or Demat format.

Let's take the Demat format as an example here.

The Units can be stored in the Demat account in the Demat format. 

Demat account can be created by taking the help of brokerage platforms like Zerodha, Groww and even [[AMC]]s like HDFC and ICICI can also help us in creating the Demat Accounts.

#qna *But what if these Brokerage accounts or AMCs get closed all of sudden? What will happen to the Demat Account that are created by these entities?*

That is where [[NSDL]] and [[CSDL]] comes into picture. These 2 entities are Stock Holding Depositories developed by Ministry of Affairs. 
##### **The depositories are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and operate independently of the brokers. And Most Importantly, this is an Indian government Organization.**

#tldr The securities in your demat account are your property. Zerodha acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions and manage your demat account but does not own your securities. So, if Zerodha or any broker were to shut down, your securities remain safe with the depository. 

> The closure of a brokerage firm or a fund house does not affect the ownership of your securities.

#qna So, the safety of the demat account is addressed. All right! But the units are provided by an AMC right? AMC is handling the shares of a company and collectively giving us the shares by a product called mutual funds. Here, the mutual fund is owned by AMC right? What if the AMC gets closed? 

Actually, the statement "the mutual fund is owned by AMC" is wrong. the mutual fund is owned by Investors. 
#### The powerhouse here is the **UNIT**. 

As long as you hold these UNITS in your disposal, then you are safe. AMC is just helping you to diversify your money in different companies. If AMC is not there, you would buy the units directly from the companies (listed and maintained in a MF managed by an AMC) and store it in your wallet (either in demat format in a demat account or as SOA). Now AMC is basically giving you a protocol to follow. If they close suddenly, the protocol is no more available to use and you need to use your owned units in a different protocol. 



#tldr you need to transfer your owned units from one AMC to other AMC in case any AMC gets closed.


In order to understand this, see the [[AMC Process]].
