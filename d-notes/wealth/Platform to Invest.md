### Where to Invest?
Now-a-days, there are a lot of services and apps to start investing.
Examples are [[Zerodha]], Upstox, Groww and much more. Cryptocurrency equivalent for these kind of apps is the Wazirx app.

#history My brother is using Zerodha and he asked me to use Zerodha. So, I am also planning to use Zerodha.

#catch There is one problem with [[Zerodha]]. If I want to invest in Mutual Funds as an NRI, it is not possible it seems.

I can still use Zerodha to buy [[Equity]] types like [[ETF]]s (NIFTY Bees and more). But if I want to invest in [[Index Fund]] (Which is a type of [[Mutual Fund]]) being an NRI in the USA, then it is not possible with a Zerodha NRI account.

So, one more option is to directly invest in [[AMC]]s (**Asset Management Company**) like HDFC Mutual fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Nippon India Mutual Fund, UTI Mutual Fund and much more.

Investing in multiple AMCs is possible but to track or manage them is a mess. That is why we need [[MFU]] (Mutual Fund Utilities) #check 

So, as of today, I am planning to use Zerodha (for ETF) and MFU (for Index Funds). #tldr
