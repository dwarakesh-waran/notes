Topic: [[Terms in Investment]]

An expense ratio isÂ **the cost of owning a mutual fund or ETF**. Think of the expense ratio as the management fee paid to the fund company for the benefit of owning the fund. The expense ratio is measured as a percent of your investment in the fund.

***Note: The expense ratio is calculated annually.***

Lets say, if a fund manager in [[AMC]] manages a large cap index fund. In order to manage the fund, the AMC is asking the people who is buying the shares from it to pay it some amount of money to manage that fund. 

So, if you buy a share worth of $100 from a fund manager, and the expense ratio of that fund is 1%, then the AMC would take the 1% from the NAV daily. So, in reality, you are buying the expense ratio adjusted shares from the NAV.

And Expense ratio is an annual rate.
