#analogy on how we invest our money in MF with an AMC
- I have 100 Rupees. 
- I am giving that 100 rupees to an AMC. 
- AMC is dividing the 100 rupees to 10 and stores 10 Rupees in 10 Boxes (Companies). 
	- This asset allocation will be changed based on the Market. That is, the AMC might remove one box and add another type of box. Also the AMC puts 5 rupees in one box and 20 rupees in one box. 
	- And if this asset allocation is happening because of the Market, then this is called Passive MF and if some person changes this diversification manually in a specific time interval, then it is called Active MF.
	- So, this means, passive MF is best because AMC is not responsible for the diversification.
- Then AMC is storing these 10 boxes, containing 10 rupees each, in a single suitcase (Mutual Fund). These suitcases are made by the AMC.
- Then the AMC is giving me (the Investor) that suitcase. Since the suitcase was given to me, I am the owner of the suitcase now.
- In the future, AMC stops making these suitcases and also stops 
- This is where the twist is. After the AMC stops making the suitcase and in turn stops the asset allocation (allocation of my money) in those boxes, I need to open the suitcase and take the boxes, with my own money inside it, and find a newly AMC who gives me a new type of Suitcase to store my boxes full of my own money.
- And here is where SEBI comes into the picture. We don't have to find a new AMC to get a new suitcase. SEBI will work with AMC to make sure that our boxes find a suitable suitcase.
- Once the suitable suitcase is found and our boxes gets diversified in the suitcase, it is upto us to either use the new suitcase or find a different one.
- And that is why it is important to buy SEBI approved suitcases. Because they will help us in case of any issue with the Suitcase.
- Life is not only like a box of chocolates. It is like a box of money.
