- Spend some time understanding the problem instead of coding it right away
- Always give away the brute force approach and be on the same page with the interviewer. Then give me the optimal solution and code the problem with the optimal solution.
- Start thinking in terms of tradeoffs. Communicate and ask questions to Interviewer regarding the space, time and stability that he/she wants.
	- For example, in the 2 sum problem, If they can have more time and less space, then brute force is the only way to solve the problem
	- If they can have more space and less time, we can suggest the 2 pointer, BST and hash tables as solutions.
