This is because the [[Selection and Bubble Sort]]s run both the outer and inner loops irrespective of the data.
Merge Sort also runs nlog(n) times irrespective of the data.
Whereas Insertion Sort has both the outer and inner loop. But the inner loop runs when the previous value is greater than the current value. In a sorted array, the previous value will never be greater than the current value, so it will run fast.
