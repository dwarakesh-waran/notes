### Difference between Permutation and Combination

Permutation is a way to arrange things and combination is a way to combine things.

In order to arrange things, order is important. If you arrange A and B, you can arrange A and B in 2 ways, AB and BA. 

In order to combine things, order is NOT Important. If you want to combine A and B, you can combine it in only 1 way -  AB. Because BA is same as AB in a combined state but different in an arrange state.

The keyword here is arrange (for permutation) and combine (for combination)
If there are 2 persons, A and B. And if there are 2 tasks, 1 and 2.

So, if you see a problem that asks to find out a number of ways, try to figure of whether the order is important or not for that specific problem (FOR THIS, YOU NEED TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO A VARIETY OF PROBLEM AND THEN THINK AND TRAIN YOUR MIND)

In Permutation, order matters. 
- Repetitions are allowed
- Repetitions are NOT allowed
In Combination, order does NOT matters.
- Repetitions are allowed
- Repetitions are NOT allowed
